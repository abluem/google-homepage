# google-homepage

I attempted to recreate the Google main page visually using my limited knowledge of HTML and CSS.
I tried to use semantic HTML to organize the code better, along with lists and a basic search form.
I used CSS to edit the colors, font, links, positioning within boxes, and floating elements.
